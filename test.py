In\nthis work, we investigate the potential of large language models to generate\npatient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data\non the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we\ndevelop a rigorous labeling protocol for hallucinations, and have two medical\nexperts annotate 100 real-world summaries and 100 generated summaries. We show\nthat fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations\nfrom 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant\ninformation. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for GPT-4\nwhen prompted with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative\nevaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. GPT-4 shows\nvery good results even in the zero-shot setting. We find that common\nquantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.\nFinally, we test GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection, which yields\npromising results.\n", 'name': 'Executor', 'role': 'user'}
